Of course. Here is a detailed explanation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.

### What is the KMP Algorithm?

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a highly efficient string-searching algorithm used to find all occurrences of a specific "pattern" within a larger "text". It is famous for its clever approach of avoiding redundant comparisons, which is a major flaw in more naive search methods.

The central innovation of KMP is that it preprocesses the **pattern** to understand its internal structure. It creates a helper array, often called an **LPS (Longest Proper Prefix which is also a Suffix)** array. This array allows the algorithm to "slide" the pattern forward intelligently after a mismatch, without ever needing to move the text pointer backward.

The algorithm works in two main phases:

1.  **The Preprocessing Phase:** Build the LPS array from the pattern.
2.  **The Searching Phase:** Search for the pattern in the main text using the LPS array to handle mismatches efficiently.

### Phase 1: The Preprocessing Phase (Building the LPS Array)

The LPS array's purpose is to store the length of the longest proper prefix of a substring that is also a suffix of that same substring.

Let's break that down:
* A **prefix** is a part of the string that starts from the beginning. (e.g., "ab", "abc" are prefixes of "abcdef").
* A **suffix** is a part of the string that ends at the end. (e.g., "ef", "def" are suffixes of "abcdef").
* A **proper** prefix or suffix is one that is not the entire string itself.

The value `lps[i]` holds the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...i]`.

**Example: Building the LPS array for the pattern "ABABC"**

Let's build the LPS array step-by-step.

| Index (i) | Substring | Proper Prefixes | Proper Suffixes | Longest Common | lps[i] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | "A" | (none) | (none) | (none) | 0 |
| 1 | "AB" | "A" | "B" | (none) | 0 |
| 2 | "ABA" | "A", "AB" | "A", "BA" | "A" | 1 |
| 3 | "ABAB" | "A", "AB", "ABA" | "B", "AB", "BAB" | "AB" | 2 |
| 4 | "ABABC" | "A", "AB", "ABA", "ABAB" | "C", "BC", "ABC", "BABC" | (none) | 0 |

So, for the pattern **"ABABC"**, the final LPS array is **`[0, 0, 1, 2, 0]`**.

### Phase 2: The Searching Phase (Using the LPS Array)

Now, we use the LPS array to search for the pattern in the text. We use two pointers:

* `i`: The pointer for the current position in the **text**.
* `j`: The pointer for the current position in the **pattern**.

We slide the pattern over the text, comparing characters `text[i]` and `pattern[j]`.

**The Magic of KMP: Handling a Mismatch**

When `text[i]` and `pattern[j]` match, we simply advance both pointers (`i++`, `j++`). The crucial part is what happens when they **don't** match.

* **Naive Approach:** Would reset the pattern pointer (`j=0`) and move the text pointer back, leading to re-comparisons.
* **KMP Approach:** Never moves the text pointer `i` backward. Instead, it consults the LPS array to find the next best position for the pattern.

The rule on a mismatch (`text[i] != pattern[j]`):
* You update the pattern pointer `j` to `lps[j-1]`. This effectively "slides" the pattern forward to a position where a prefix of the pattern aligns with a suffix of the text we just matched.
* If `j` is already `0` and a mismatch occurs, it means we can't slide the pattern further, so we just move to the next character in the text (`i++`).

**Example: Search for "ABABC" in the text "ABABDABABC"**

**Pattern:** `ABABC`
**LPS Array:** `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0]`
**Text:** `ABABDABABC`

Let's trace the pointers `i` (for text) and `j` (for pattern).

1.  `i=0, j=0`: 'A' == 'A'. Match. `i=1, j=1`.
2.  `i=1, j=1`: 'B' == 'B'. Match. `i=2, j=2`.
3.  `i=2, j=2`: 'A' == 'A'. Match. `i=3, j=3`.
4.  `i=3, j=3`: 'B' == 'B'. Match. `i=4, j=4`.
5.  `i=4, j=4`: 'D' != 'C'. **Mismatch!**
    * We consult the LPS array. The mismatch happened at `j=4`.
    * We set `j = lps[j-1] = lps[3] = 2`.
    * **Crucially, `i` stays at 4.** We don't re-compare the "AB" prefix we know already matches.

6.  `i=4, j=2`: 'D' != 'A'. **Mismatch!**
    * Mismatch at `j=2`. We set `j = lps[j-1] = lps[1] = 0`.

7.  `i=4, j=0`: 'D' != 'A'. **Mismatch!**
    * `j` is already 0. We can't slide anymore. We just advance the text pointer: `i=5`.

8.  `i=5, j=0`: 'A' == 'A'. Match. `i=6, j=1`.
9.  `i=6, j=1`: 'B' == 'B'. Match. `i=7, j=2`.
10. `i=7, j=2`: 'A' == 'A'. Match. `i=8, j=3`.
11. `i=8, j=3`: 'B' == 'B'. Match. `i=9, j=4`.
12. `i=9, j=4`: 'C' == 'C'. Match. `i=10, j=5`.

Now, `j=5`, which is the length of the pattern. **This means a full match has been found**, ending at index `i-1 = 9`.

### Why is KMP So Efficient?

KMP's brilliance lies in its time complexity.

* The pointer for the text (`i`) **never moves backward**. It only ever increments, making a single pass through the text.
* The preprocessing step takes time proportional to the length of the pattern (`m`).
* The searching phase takes time proportional to the length of the text (`n`).

This results in a total time complexity of **O(n + m)**, which is a significant improvement over the naive O(n * m) approach, especially for long texts and patterns.
