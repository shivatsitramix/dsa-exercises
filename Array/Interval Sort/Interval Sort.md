A concise explanation of interval merging will be provided, including its definition, the key steps of the algorithm, and a straightforward example to illustrate the process.

***

Interval merging is a process where you combine overlapping or adjacent intervals in a list into a single, consolidated interval. The goal is to produce a new list of intervals that cover the same total range but with no overlaps.

For example, if you have the intervals `[1, 4]` and `[3, 7]`, they overlap and can be merged into `[1, 7]`.

### The Algorithm

The process to merge intervals is straightforward and relies on sorting.

1.  **Sort the Intervals**: First, you need to sort the list of intervals based on their **start times**. This is the most important step, as it ensures you can process the intervals in order.

2.  **Initialize a Result List**: Create a new list to store your merged intervals. Add the very first interval from your sorted list to this new list to get started.

3.  **Iterate and Merge**: Now, go through the rest of the sorted intervals one by one and compare the current interval with the *last* interval in your result list.
    * **If they overlap**: An overlap occurs if the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last interval in your result list. When they overlap, you merge them by updating the end of the last interval in the result list to be the *maximum* of its current end and the current interval's end.
    * **If they don't overlap**: If the current interval starts *after* the last one in your result list ends, there's no overlap. In this case, simply add the current interval to your result list as a new, separate interval.

4.  **Return the Result**: Once you've gone through all the intervals, the result list will contain the final, merged intervals.

### A Simple Example

Let's merge the following intervals: `[[1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6], [15, 18]]`

1.  **Sort them by the start time**:
    `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`

2.  **Initialize the result list**:
    `merged_intervals = [[1, 3]]`

3.  **Iterate and Merge**:
    * **Next interval is `[2, 6]`**:
        * Does it overlap with `[1, 3]`? Yes, because `2` (start) is less than `3` (end).
        * Merge them: The new end is `max(3, 6)`, which is `6`.
        * `merged_intervals` is now `[[1, 6]]`.
    * **Next interval is `[8, 10]`**:
        * Does it overlap with `[1, 6]`? No, because `8` is greater than `6`.
        * Add it to the list.
        * `merged_intervals` is now `[[1, 6], [8, 10]]`.
    * **Next interval is `[15, 18]`**:
        * Does it overlap with `[8, 10]`? No, because `15` is greater than `10`.
        * Add it to the list.
        * `merged_intervals` is now `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.

4.  **Final Result**: The final merged list is `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.
